Challenges: 
* I had trouble with getting the appending to work with the ending "done" part.
* I don't even know if I fixed it, but I can't get the strikethrough to work. I'm not sure if i just don't have the correct textDecoration value or what, it just won't work.
* I accidentally created something as "task" instead of div, which made it so the background color wasn't turning red.
*I faced many small issues that built up towards larger things. Like, for instance I couldnâ€™t get .js styling to work for a long time.
*I struggled with remembering the values for things like checkboxes. It took me forever to go through previous repos and find out that I needed to use .checked.
Approach Changing: 
*I started to add the encapsulating <div> around a lot of stuff. It helped with moving stuff around through.css
Questions:
* How do I get it all on the same line if I'm approaching it with a <p></p> seperation?
